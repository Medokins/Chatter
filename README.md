# Chatter 

A chat bot that can imitate personality of a given person based on facebook (messenger) conversations.

### In development 
I've sent a request to download all data directly from facebook (settings&privacy -> settings -> Your Facebook Information -> Download Your Information) since scraping method is suspicious to facebook (got some account warnings that it detected a login attempt from my program and blocked it).<br>

(most of the code from main.py file comes from [Tech With Tim's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzzHOvpqDYs&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-ndH9FoC4YWHGXG5RZekt-Q&index=3) video for now.)

I think I'm gonna put this project on hold for now, since I don't have enought knowledge and computing power to set up full deep learning model that is required to do such conversations.<br>
I might try to fill responses corresponding to intents into the intents.json file but this is very naive since the bot would answer only already asked questions (in the training conversation).
If You're lookin for state of the art converional AI with many characters personalities I highly recommend [Character.AI](https://beta.character.ai/) site.
