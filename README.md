I'm currently working on a way of acquiring data (conversations) from facebook, but it's a bit tricky to find a valid way with facebook/meta's dynamic changes. <br><br>
I've sent a request to download all data directly from facebook (settings&privacy -> settings -> Your Facebook Information -> Download Your Information) since the above method is suspicious to facebook (got some account warnings that it detected a login attempt from my program and blocked it).

I'm still waiting for facebook to send that data and in the meantime i'm trying to come up with tags for future AI to fit into.
