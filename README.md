I'm currently working on a way of acquiring data (conversations) from facebook, but it's a bit tricky to find a valid way with facebook/meta's dynamic changes. <br><br>
I've sent a request to download all data directly from facebook (settings&privacy -> settings -> Your Facebook Information -> Download Your Information) since the above method is suspicious to facebook (got some account warnings that it detected a login attempt from my program and blocked it).
