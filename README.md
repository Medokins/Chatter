# Chatter 

A chat bot that can imitate personality of a given person based on facebook (messenger) conversations.

### In development 
I've sent a request to download all data directly from facebook (settings&privacy -> settings -> Your Facebook Information -> Download Your Information) since scraping method is suspicious to facebook (got some account warnings that it detected a login attempt from my program and blocked it).<br>

After 10 days I've recieved data and i'm currently working on a way to split it into correct intents with chosen respones
(which turned out to be really tricky).<br>
(most of the code from main.py file comes from [Tech With Tim's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzzHOvpqDYs&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-ndH9FoC4YWHGXG5RZekt-Q&index=3) video for now.)
